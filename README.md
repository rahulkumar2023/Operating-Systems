### README for GitHub Repository: **Operating Systems**

---

#### **Overview**
The **Operating Systems** repository contains Python scripts that simulate key concepts and algorithms in operating systems. These programs explore multiprocessing, threading, inter-process communication (IPC), CPU scheduling, and memory management. Each script is designed for educational purposes and provides hands-on examples of theoretical concepts.

#### **Files in This Repository**

1. **`Multiprocessing.py`**
   - **Description:** Explores the performance of I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks using Python's `multiprocessing` module.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Simulates I/O-bound tasks with system calls and delays.
     - Simulates CPU-bound tasks with intensive computations.
     - Measures CPU utilization before and after task execution.

2. **`IPCUsingMessageQueue.py`**
   - **Description:** Demonstrates basic Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using a message queue between a parent and a single child process.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Simple IPC using the `multiprocessing.Queue`.
     - A single child process sends a message to the parent process.

3. **`IPCUsingMessageQueueVersion2.py`**
   - **Description:** Extends the `IPCUsingMessageQueue.py` script to support multiple child processes, each sending multiple messages to the parent process.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Dynamic number of child processes and messages.
     - Demonstrates synchronization and message handling.

4. **`RoundRobinScheduling.py`**
   - **Description:** Implements the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Allows user input for the time quantum.
     - Displays execution order, waiting times, and turnaround times.
     - Calculates average waiting and turnaround times.

5. **`RoundRobinSchedulingVersion2.py`**
   - **Description:** Enhances the original Round Robin scheduling script with features like execution order tracking and context switch counting.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Tracks execution order and number of context switches.
     - Provides a detailed output of scheduling results.

6. **`Threading.py`**
   - **Description:** Simulates a collaborative writing and editing environment using threading.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Writers submit articles, and editors review them using semaphores and locks.
     - Demonstrates synchronization and avoidance of race conditions.

7. **`TwoLevelPageTableTLBSimulation.py`**
   - **Description:** Simulates a two-level page table and Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) to explore virtual-to-physical address translation.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Simulates TLB hits, TLB misses, and page faults.
     - Uses various access patterns (sequential, random, and repeated).
